1 Question 1 (15      points)      Suppose there are I   ﬁrms in an industry.    Each ﬁrm can try to   convince   Congress   to   implement   a   subsidy   in   this   industry. Let   hi    ≥ 0   denote   the hours   of   efort   put      in   by   ﬁrm   i. When   the   efort levels   of   the   ﬁrms      are   h =   (h1   ,   h2,...,   hI   ),   the   value   of the   subsidy   that   gets   approved   is:
where   a,   b ≥ 0   are   constants.         The   cost   of   efort   to ﬁrm i   is   c(hi   )      =   whi(2)
where   w   > 0   is   a   constant.      Firm   i’s   payof is   si    − c(hi   ).
(a)    (10 points) For what set of parameters   a,b,w do the ﬁrms have a dominant   strategy?
(b)    (5    points)    Make a prediction about the size of   the subsidy when your   conditions   in   (i)   are   satisﬁed.
2 Question 2 (15    points)    Consider a two-player game in   which   player 1 chooses a number   (n1   )   on   the   interval    [0, ∞   )   and   player   2   chooses   a   number    (n2   )   on   the   interval   (   −∞   ,   0]   and   the   payofs   to   each   player   are   ⇧   =   n1   n2
(a)      (3   points)   (i)   Find   strictly   dominated   strategies   for   each   player,   if any.    (ii)   Does   IESDS   yield   a   unique   solution   to   this   game?
(b)代 写ECON 485 Quiz 1R
代做程序编程语言    (12   points)   Now,   consider   weakly   dominated   strategies.      (i)   Find   weakly   dominated      strategies      for      each      player,    if   any.       (ii)    Does    IEWDS    yield    a   unique   solution   to   this   game?   If so,   does   the   order   of deletion   matter?
3 Question 3 
(10   points)   Assume   x   ≥   0.      Find   all   pure   strategy   NE   of   the   following   game.   Can   you   make   a   prediction   about   the   outcome   of the   game?
4 Question 4 (20   points)   The   price   in   the   market   is   given   by   P(q1   ,   q2   )   =   1 −   q1   −   q2   ,   where   q1   and   q2    are   the   quantities   produced   by   the   two   ﬁrms.      The   cost   function   of each   ﬁrm   is   given   by:

(a)    (10   points)   Suppose   α = β   =   1.    Find   the   Nash   equilibrium   output   levels   when   the   ﬁrms   choose   outputs   simultaneously.
(b)    (10 points)   Suppose β   =   1 is held   ﬁxed.   What   do   you   expect   to   happen   to   equilibrium quantities when   (i) α increases   from   1   (ii)   α decreases   from   1?   Draw   best   responses   to   support   your   claim.    (No   need   to   solve   for   actual   quantities)
